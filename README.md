<h1>Analyze NFL Stats with Python<h1>

<h2>Overview<h2>
This case study takes you through an analysis of NFL games for 32 teams in the 2021 season. Throughout the analysis you will:

<ul>
    <li>visualize game stats</li>
    <li>model those stats to predict winning games</li>
    <li>tune your model to improve accuracy</li>
    <li>uncover which stats were most influential</li>
</ul>
<h2>Dataset</h2>
The dataset weâ€™re working with comprises NFL game stats during the 2021 NFL season. They contain offensive and defensive stats for each game played by each team (including postseason games where applicable) as well as game details such as which teams are competing, the date of the matchup, and the outcome of the game. This dataset was cleaned and modified to include only the stats we need for our analysis. To see the unaltered stats and much more, you can visit the data source on the site [Pro Football Reference](https://www.pro-football-reference.com/).
